Lightning is a framework for data processing using GPUs on distributed platforms.
The framework allows distributed multi-GPU execution of compute kernels functions written in CUDA in a way that is similar to programming a single GPU, without worrying about low-level details such as network communication, memory management, and data transfers.
This enables scaling of existing GPU kernels to much larger problem sizes, for beyond the memory capacity of a single GPU.
Lightning efficiently distributes the work/data across GPUS and maximizes efficiency by overlapping scheduling, data movement, and work when possible.

## Installation Guide
The project is written in Rust and has been tested with Rust 1.56.
To build the project, use `cargo`.

```bash
cargo build --release
```
